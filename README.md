# Datatas_R-for-beginners
**Workshop covering R programming fundamentals**  

For this workshop you will need to bring your own computer. Ensure you have R (version 4.0) and RStudio installed in your computer. If you use a Windows machine, it is also a good idea to install RTools.  

If you prefer not to install R and RStudio in your computer, you can use RStudio Cloud [https://rstudio.cloud/] or Google Colab [https://colab.to/r]. Both options are available for free and do not require any installation.
  
We will also use the following packages: `tidyverse`, `palmerpenguins`, `readr` and `stringi`. So if you do not have these package installed in your computer yet, use this command: `install.packages("name_of_the_package")`. Ensure you change the name between the quotation marks for the library that you need.
